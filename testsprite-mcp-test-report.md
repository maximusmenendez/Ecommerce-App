### Requirement: Protected Routes Access Control
- **Description:** Ensures authenticated users can access protected endpoints while unauthorized access is denied.

#### Test 1
- **Test ID:** TC005
- **Test Name:** protected_routes_access_control_for_authenticated_users
- **Test Code:** [code_file](./TC005_protected_routes_access_control_for_authenticated_users.py)
- **Test Error:** N/A
- **Test Visualization and Result:** https://www.testsprite.com/dashboard/mcp/tests/d69466b1-326e-4430-a25b-9201a1a2b307/78381142-83ea-403c-b819-1ee16c6e2588
- **Status:** ✅ Passed
- **Severity:** LOW
- **Analysis / Findings:** Protected API routes enforce JWT authentication, preventing unauthorized access to user-specific data and checkout endpoints. Access control is effective. To enhance security, consider implementing token expiration handling and refresh token mechanisms as needed.
